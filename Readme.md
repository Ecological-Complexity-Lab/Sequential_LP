This is an algorithm developed for temporal network that is based on the previous algorithm introduced in:
https://github.com/Aghasemian/OptimalLinkPrediction
"Stacking Models for Nearly Optimal Link Prediction in Complex Networks", To appear, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2020)
Amir Ghasemian, Homa Hosseinmardi, Aram Galstyan, Edoardo M. Airoldi and Aaron Clauset


We tried to modify the algorithm to apply the algorithm on temporal networks and multilayer networks. 
The codes will be updated and the link to the preprint paper will be added as we progress.
