to create the required environmnet for the code

The example runs could be found in example.py, which runs through one of the 90 synthetic network datasets we created.

To run through the real-world networks, please download them through the Google Drive Link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sfycenFPrYXBHSUlJ7ovEIYHFY5-mGg2?usp=drive_link

The synthetic dataset are also in the same folder, feel free to download and try them.

You could also find the past bugged version of the code both in the same folder and on Github for debugging purposes. The noticable change could be found in the Github history.
