Use the commend

##
conda env create -f environment.yml 
##

to create the required environmnet for the code

The example runs could be found in example.py, which runs through one of the 90 synthetic network datasets we created.

To run through the synthetic networks, please download them through the Google Drive Link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sfycenFPrYXBHSUlJ7ovEIYHFY5-mGg2?usp=drive_link

The real world networks could be found under the following links, due to copy right reasons, we will only show the link to download them:
